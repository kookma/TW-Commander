<div style="padding-left:25px;font-size:0.9em">

The cleanup attribute determines which optional post-processing should be applied to the diffs:

* semantic (default): rewrites the diffs for human readability
* efficient: rewrites the diffs to minimise the number of operations for subsequent processing
