# Use ''Search via filter'' to list possible tiddlers
#* example: `[tag[xx]]` finds all tiddlers tagged with //xx//
#* example: `[prefix[tt]` finds all tiddlers have title started with //tt//
#* example: `[has[draft.of]sort[title]]` finds all draft tiddlers

# Use ''Select tiddlers'' for the resulting list to identify which specific tiddlers to do a batch operation on
#* this step lets you to do a batch operation on selected tiddlers NOT all filtered by ''Filter search''!
#* it is possible to select/deselect all tiddlers from ''Filter search'' result at once!
# From ''Batch operations tabs'' select the batch operation you wish to perform on selected tiddlers
#* example: title, tag, and field operations
#* example: Snr operation
#* example: Inspect operation

* Notes:
** Multiple batch operations can be done on the same set (unless you change something in the search criteria)
** Sometimes it is useful to use an intermediate batch to help, like tag tiddlers with a "working" tag, using multiple searches, then then use the "working" tag to apply a batch operation to

<<commander-alert """''Note'': For good operation a tiddler width of 800px is recommended. You can also use //Sidebar layout// as `Fluid story`. """>>
