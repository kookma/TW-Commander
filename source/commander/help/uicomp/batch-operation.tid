!! What is batch operation?
<<<
Making the same changes to large numbers of tiddlers in TW5 can be repetetive and time consuming.

* Batch operations work on groups of tiddlers at the same time and make changes 'in bulk', in one go.

* Batch operations operate on groups of tiddlers that share matching criteria.

* Tiddlers which share  a common tag, a common field, a word in their title, or were  created on the same day, month or year are all candidates for batch operations.

<<commander-alert """As a result batch operations can save users a great deal of time but, because they work on several tiddlers at once, the price of a mistake is multiplied! ''Back-up your wiki!''""">>
<<<

!! Types of Batch operations :
<<<
* Rename tiddlers
** use  a totally new name

** add prefix to title
** replace part of title
** add ordinal number to title 

* Add/remove tag or any field

* Create multiple empty tiddlers (for lectures or a slideshow) with common properties (tag, field, part of text,...)
* Capability to get user confirmation before doing some operations
